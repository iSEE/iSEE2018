# Interactive visualization with _iSEE_

The [_iSEE_](https://github.com/csoneson/iSEE) package provides an interactive user interface for exploring data in objects derived from the `SummarizedExperiment` class.

This repository contains the code required to construct the tours described in the _iSEE_ paper by [Rue-Albrecht _et al._](http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.14966.1)

**Note:** these tours can be resumed from within their respective iSEE application instance, using the question mark icon in the top-right corner of the _Shiny_ application ( <img src=img/help.png height="20" width="20"> ).

# Setting up the tours

## Overview

Each tour is composed of three files:

- `data.R`: a script that contains the instructions to pre-process the data into a `SummarizedExperiment` or `SingleCellExperiment` object ready for _iSEE_.
- `tour.txt`: a set of step-wise instructions attached to various UI elements in the _iSEE_ user interface.
- `app.R`: a script that uses the object generated by `data.R` to configure the _iSEE_ application and launch the tour.

To launch a tour, successively execute `data.R` and `app.R`.

## Docker containers

In addition, each tour is accompanied in this repository by two additional files illustrating the distribution of preconfigured _iSEE_ applications in the form of [Docker](https://www.docker.com) images, published on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com):

- `Dockerfile`: command-line instructions for `docker build` to assemble the image.
- `docker.R`: wrapper for `app.R` (see above) that is executed by the Docker container on startup; it launches the preconfigured app on port `1234` of the container.

The port `1234` of a container can be published to any available port of the host machine using the `-p` option of `docker run`.
For instance, `docker run -p 1234:5678` makes the Shiny app available at http://localhost:5678 for the host machine.

Please refer to the [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com) for further details.

## Allen

The `data.R` script uses the Allen data subset in the the [_scRNAseq_](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/scRNAseq.html) Bioconductor package.
It performs a small number of pre-processing steps (e.g., normalization, dimensionality reduction) before saving a serialized `SingleCellExperiment` object to file.

**Live demo:** https://marionilab.cruk.cam.ac.uk/iSEE_allen

**Docker demo:**
```
docker pull kevinrue/isee_allen
docker run -i --rm -p 1234:1234 kevinrue/isee_allen
```

## TCGA

The `data.R` script fetches the TCGA data set from the Bioconductor [ExperimentHub](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ExperimentHub.html) in the form of an `ExpressionSet`.
It converts this to a `SingleCellExperiment` object and performs a small number of preprocessing steps (e.g., PCA, _t_-SNE) before saving the object to file.

**Note:** the first time that the script is run, it may take a few extra minutes, as it downloads and caches a copy of the data set if you haven't one already. 
Subsequent runs of the script will launch the tour significantly faster, as they will use the locally cached data set. 
Refer to the documentation of the [ExperimentHub](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ExperimentHub.html) for further details.

**Live demo:** https://marionilab.cruk.cam.ac.uk/iSEE_tcga

**Docker demo:**
```
docker pull kevinrue/isee_tcga
docker run -i --rm -p 1234:1234 kevinrue/isee_tcga
```

## PBMC 4K

This is somewhat more involved as the relevant data, while publicly available, need to be processed and analyzed.
This can be achieved by following these steps:

1. Download and unpack the PBMC 4K dataset from the [10X Genomics website](http://cf.10xgenomics.com/samples/cell-exp/2.1.0/pbmc4k/pbmc4k_raw_gene_bc_matrices.tar.gz).
2. Run the [analysis script](https://github.com/MarioniLab/EmptyDrops2017/tree/master/analysis/pbmc4k/analysis.Rmd).
Modify the `fname` variable according to the path to the unpacked PBMC data files.
3. Move the generated `sce.rds` object into `tours/` and run `pbmc4k_app.R`.

**Live demo:** https://marionilab.cruk.cam.ac.uk/iSEE_pbmc4k

**Docker demo:**
```
docker pull kevinrue/isee_pbmc4k
docker run -i --rm -p 1234:1234 kevinrue/isee_pbmc4k
```

## CyTOF

The `data.R` script downloads a preprocesed version of the data set from [Bodenmiller et al (2012)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2317). 
See the [`HDCytoData`](http://bioconductor.org/packages/HDCytoData/) package for more information about how the data was processed.

**Docker demo:**
```
docker pull kevinrue/isee_cytof
docker run -i --rm -p 1234:1234 kevinrue/isee_cytof
```
