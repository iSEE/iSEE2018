#Welcome;<p align="left">This tour illustrates salient features of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA-Sequencing and clinical data for 7,706 tumor samples, based on count data reported by <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/31/22/3666/240143" target="_blank">Rahman et al. (Bioinformatics, 2015)</a></p>
#Welcome;<p align="left">The data set contains measurements for 23,368 genes in 7,706 tumor samples, across 20 cancer types.</p><p align="left">In addition, the data set includes 421 clinical variables collected as sample metadata.</p>
#colDataPlot1;<p align="left">The distribution of samples across cancer type and gender can be easily vizualized using a <font color="#3c8dbc">Column data plot</font> panel.</p><p align="left">In particular, note how breast cancer samples (i.e., 'BRCA') from female patients are already selected. This allows downstream linked panels to selectively highlight or restrict those samples when they display data.</p>
#colDataPlot1_DataBoxOpen;<p align="left">Sample metadata shown on the X and Y axes were set using the <i>Data parameters</i> box.</p>
#colDataPlot1_VisualBoxOpen;<p align="left">Similarly, the <i>Visual parameters</i> box provides control over the color, point and other aspects of the data points.</p>
#colDataPlot1_ColorBy;<p align="left">Here, we reinforce the cancer type information by color.</p>
#colDataPlot1_Downsample;<p align="left">Given the considerable number of samples, we visually downsample data points to display and update panels more rapidly.</p><p align="left">Note that downsampling only has a <em>visual</em> effect. Hidden data points are still included in selections.</p>
#colDataPlot1_LegendPosition;<p align="left">Lastly, we also moved the legend to the right of the plotting panel (the default is 'Bottom').</p>
#colDataPlot1_PanelGeneralInfo;<p align="left">Conveniently, the count and proportion of samples selected is shown whenever an active selection is detected.</p>
#colDataPlot1_PanelLinkInfo;<p align="left">Furthermore, any incoming or outgoing selection link with another panel is reported here.</p><p align="left">In this example, the panel is sending its point selection to two other panels that we will examine in a moment.</p>
#redDimPlot1;<p align="left"><font color="#3c8dbc">Reduced dimension plot</font> panels provide an overview of the data in any precomputed reduced dimensions, such as <i>t</i>-SNE.</p><p align="left">Conveniently, any sample metadata or feature assay value may be overlaid as color onto the data points, and linked selections received from other panels can be highlighted.</p>
#redDimPlot1_ColorBy;<p align="left">Here, we use color to highlight again the distribution of each cancer type.</p>
#redDimPlot1_PanelLinkInfo;<p align="left">Furthermore, this panel receives the breast cancer tumor samples selected in the <font color="#3c8dbc">Column data plot</font> panel described earlier.</p>
#redDimPlot1_SelectEffect;<p align="left">The point selection received is applied with a transparency effect, that reduces the visibility of unselected data points to 10%, by default.</p>
#redDimPlot1_Downsample;<p align="left">Again, note how downsampling is applied to render the panel faster.</p>
#redDimPlot1_SampleRes;<p align="left">In this example, the plot is divided horizontally and vertically in 100 bins, showing no more than one data point per bin, and hiding additional data points from sight.</p>
#featAssayPlot1;<p align="left">In this <font color="#3c8dbc">Feature assay plot</font> panel, we examine the expression of <i>HER2</i> (also known as <i>ERBB2</i>), reported to be overexpressed in breast cancer cells relative to controls by <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/31/22/3666/240143" target="_blank">Rahman et al. (Bioinformatics, 2015)</a>.</p><p align="left">For the purpose of this tour, the other cancer types may be considered as control samples (i.e., not breast cancer).</p>
#featAssayPlot1_DataBoxOpen;<p align="left">To visualize the differential expression, we used the <i>Data parameters</i> box to:</p><ul><li>assign <i>ERBB2</i> to the Y-axis</li><li>show gene expression values from the assay that holds log<sub>2</sub> count per million (CPM) values</li><li>separate cancer types on the X axis</li></ul>
#featAssayPlot1_Downsample;<p align="left">For this panel too, we apply downsampling.</p>
#collapse_featAssayPlot1_SelectBoxOpen;<p align="left">To highlight the breast cancer tumor samples from female patients selected in the <font color="#3c8dbc">Column data plot</font> panel, we:<ul><li>Select it as the source of point selection</li><li>apply the selection with a color effect (red, by default)</li></ul>
#featAssayPlot1;<p align="left">This applies the selected color to the selected samples, leaving others in their default color.</p><p align="left">The resulting effect confirms the overexpression of <i>ERBB2</i> in breast cancer cells, as reported by <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/31/22/3666/240143" target="_blank">Rahman et al. (Bioinformatics, 2015)</a>.</p>
#GoodBye;<p align="left">Thank you for taking the TCGA tour!</p>
